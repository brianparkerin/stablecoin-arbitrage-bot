To start with python on Linux run de follow commands:

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv python3-pip

Get update de system and verify de versions still working as well: 

$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade



To verify if Python was successfully installed, 
run the following command in the terminal:

$ python3 --version / $ python3 -v

xczzxzcz
So, if you don't install pip yet :

$ sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip


To do so, just enter the following command, replacing the package_name with the name of the one you wish to install:

$ pip3 install package_name


Finally, it is important to install a series of packages to make your programming environment more consistent. To do so, use the command:

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev


### Configuring a Python virtual environment on Ubuntu Linux:

To create these environments, install a module called venv, which is present in the Python library. Then, proceed  with the installation of  venv with the following command:

$ sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv


To create new virtual environments for your project:

$ mkdir directory_env
$ cd directory_env


Once in the directory where to create the new environments, create the first one using the venv module . To do so, follow the command:

$ python -m venv 


Salir de bash:

$ source ~/.profile
$ conda deactivate
